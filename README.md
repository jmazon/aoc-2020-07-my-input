This repository contains the git representation of my [Advent of Code 2020 day 7][aoc] puzzle input.  See [my blog post][blog] for more details.

This is the `master` branch, which is the only one to actually contain any files (the one you're reading).  The action happens on:
* the [part-1][p1] branch: a merge commit from all the tagged bags from part 1.
* the [part-2][p2] branch: my shiny gold bag with all contained commits deduplicated.

I'm afraid the github interface isn't too great for browsing this sort of tree.  You'd better just clone it and examine locally.

I have [another repo][sample] with the much readable graphs from the statement's sample.
